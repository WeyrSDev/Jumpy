Description
=============
Jumpy is a clone of the well-known Doodle Jump game created by [Lima Sky](http://www.limasky.com/) and originally developed for iOS but in the meantime also ported to Android.
The first version of Jumpy, back then it had the name 'Doodle Jumpy', was released for the [19th SCC](http://forum.sfml-dev.de/index.php/topic,845.0.html) ([SFML Community Contest](http://sfml-dev.de/scc)) of the [German speaking SFML community](http://sfml-dev.de/). Within this one year my skills with C++ and SFML have greatly advanced and SFML itself has undergone big changes, which led me to refactor the game and I've now come to a state where the new version is fully playable. In the future I'll keep refactoring and cleaning up the codebase, perhaps even add new features.

=============
With the refactoring I've introduced the [SmallGameEngine](https://github.com/eXpl0it3r/SmallGameEngine) into the game, it's heavily based on the '[Managing Game States in C++](http://gamedevgeek.com/tutorials/managing-game-states-in-c/)' tutorial by [Anthony Lewis](http://anthonylewis.com/), so a big thanks to him for that tutorial.
And obviously the biggest thank you goes to Laurent, for his awesomeness in constantly developing and maintaining one of the [best C++ libraries](http://www.sfml-dev.org/).
